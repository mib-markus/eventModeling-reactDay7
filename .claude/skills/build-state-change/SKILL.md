## What a State Change Slice is

One `COMMAND` element (`slice.json.commands[]`) that, when submitted, causes one or more `EVENT`
elements (`slice.json.events[]`) to be recorded by the backend. This stack builds only the
**frontend half**: a dedicated React component that collects the command's data (via props — this
component never fetches or owns its own data) and POSTs it to an already-existing backend
endpoint, via `postCommand` in `src/lib/api.ts` — never `fetch` directly. It does not generate any
server-side code.

Every component must be renderable and testable **in isolation**, with no real backend running —
see Step 4 (numbered `samples/`) and `src/lib/api.ts`'s `VITE_DATA_MODE=mock`, which makes
`postCommand` resolve locally instead of hitting the network.

## Step 1 — Read slice.json

Extract:
- **title**, **context** — slice identity, used for file paths (see Step 3).
- **commands[0]** — the command element. Each `Element` carries:
  - `title` — the command name, e.g. `"ReserveBike"`.
  - `fields[]` — one entry per data field (`name`, `type`, `optional?`, `cardinality?`, `example?`,
    `subfields?`). This is the **exact and complete** set of props the component takes — no more,
    no fewer.
  - `apiEndpoint` — the path to POST to. **Read this literally from slice.json when it's present**
    — do not guess a REST convention, invent a path, or infer one from the command name while a real
    one exists. **When `apiEndpoint` is missing** (no backend endpoint decided yet), flag it but keep
    building — this is a partial variant of `request-feedback`, not a full stop:
    1. Post a comment on this slice node naming the command and stating the endpoint is missing
       (`mcp__eventmodelers__add_comment`, same call `request-feedback` Step 3 uses), and mark the
       slice `Blocked` (`mcp__eventmodelers__update_slice_status`, same as `request-feedback` Step 4).
    2. Unlike a normal `request-feedback` escalation, **do not stop here** — continue on to build the
       component exactly as normal, but against a mocked backend: give `postCommand` a clearly
       provisional path, e.g. `/api/mock/<command-title-kebab-case>`, with a one-line comment marking
       it as a placeholder pending the real endpoint. `postCommand` already resolves locally under
       `VITE_DATA_MODE=mock` regardless of what the path string is (see `src/lib/api.ts`), so the
       component is fully functional offline either way — only make Step 4's samples do extra work in
       this case: cover every `command.fields[]` entry with realistic, meaningful values (never
       placeholders like `"foo"`/`"test"`), plus whatever edge cases `specifications[]` call out,
       since those samples are the only data this slice will see until a real endpoint is wired in.
    3. Leave the slice's status as `Blocked` when you finish (see this stack's `CLAUDE.md` "Building
       a Slice" step 6) — the built, mocked component still needs a real endpoint before it's done,
       so don't flip it to `Done`.
  - `description` — implementation hints (validation rules, business constraints).
- **events[]** — informational only (what the backend is expected to emit); this stack does not
  act on them directly.
- **screens[]** — the actor `SCREEN` element(s) that trigger this command, if any. Empty when the
  command has no UI trigger (rare — build the component from fields alone in that case, skip Step
  2).
- **specifications[]** — GWT scenarios; treat as acceptance criteria for the component's business
  logic (e.g. "given empty `email`, submit is disabled").

> **Comments**: each element carries `comments: string[]` (board comments) — read them as
> implementation hints, and resolve consumed ones via
> `POST <BASE_URL>/api/org/<ORG_ID>/boards/<BOARD_ID>/nodes/<nodeId>/comments/<commentId>/resolve`.

## Step 2 — Read the screen, and especially its marks

`slice.json`'s `screens[]` entries only carry `id`/`title`/`fields[]`/`description` (fields already
scoped to this slice) — not the actual markup. Fetch the live node to get that:

```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_node { "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "nodeId": "<screen.id>" }
```

This returns the full `meta`, including `pages: string[]` (one HTML fragment per page) and,
if the screen is shared across several slices, `marks: [{ id, color, pageIndex, blurOutside?,
whiteOutside? }]`.

- **If `meta.marks` is non-empty**: the same visual screen is shared by multiple slices, each
  highlighting a different part. Find the mark(s) belonging to this node, then in
  `meta.pages[mark.pageIndex]` locate the element carrying `data-em-mark-id="<mark.id>"` — **that
  HTML subtree, not the rest of the page, is the blueprint for what this component builds.**
  Ignore markup outside it; it belongs to other slices.
- **If `meta.marks` is empty**: the whole page (every entry in `meta.pages`, in order, for a
  multi-step flow) is the blueprint.
- **If `screens[]` was empty in Step 1**: there is no visual reference — build the component from
  `fields[]` alone, with plain, unstyled form markup.

If this project has a `learn-styleguide` skill installed (`.claude/skills/learn-styleguide/`),
read its references before turning markup into JSX and prefer its tokens/component classes over
whatever ad hoc styling the mockup used — the mockup gives you *structure and content*, the style
guide gives you the real visual language when the two disagree.

**Also resolve this screen's lane** (skip if `screens[]` was empty in Step 1 — see Step 3's file
path): the actor row this screen sits in becomes a folder segment. Fetch it cheaply with:

```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_board_outline { "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "chapterId": "<screen node's chapterId>" }
```

This returns `{id, type, title, lane}` for every node in the chapter — find the entry whose `id`
matches `screen.id` and take its `lane`. Slugify it the same way `contextSlug` is derived
(lowercase, spaces to hyphens, non-alphanumeric stripped) to get `laneSlug`.

## Step 3 — Build the dedicated component

**File**: `src/slices/<contextSlug>/<laneSlug>/<sliceFolder>/<CommandTitle>.tsx` — `contextSlug` and
`sliceFolder` are derived exactly as in `load-slice` (lowercase-slugified context; slice title
lowercased with spaces removed and any `slice:` prefix stripped); `laneSlug` comes from Step 2
above. Omit the `<laneSlug>` segment (fall back to `<contextSlug>/<sliceFolder>/`) only for the
rare headless command with no `screens[]` at all — there's no lane to resolve without a screen.
Note this nests one level deeper than the staging data in
`.build-kit/.slices/<contextSlug>/<sliceFolder>/slice.json` — `load-slice`'s own local index has no
lane concept, so the frontend path isn't a strict 1:1 mirror of it. `CommandTitle` is the command's
`title` verbatim (e.g. `ReserveBike.tsx`).

**Markup**: translate the blueprint HTML from Step 2 into JSX **1:1** — same tags, same classes
(Bulma or whatever the mockup used), same layout and copy. This is not a redesign; the screen *is*
the design. Only change what must become dynamic:
- A field's example value becomes that input's controlled `value`.
- An element repeated for a `cardinality: "List"` field becomes a `.map()` over that field.
- `class`/`style`/structure otherwise stay exactly as drawn.

**Props**: exactly `command.fields[]`, typed per each field's `type` (`String`→`string`,
`Boolean`→`boolean`, `Int`/`Long`→`number`, etc. — `subfields[]` become a nested object type),
respecting `optional`. Add two callback props: `onSuccess?: (result: TResponse) => void` and
`onError?: (error: ApiError) => void`. **No other inputs** — no context/store reads, no fetching
inside the component. All business data the component needs arrives via props from its parent.

**Default — keep the logic in the component.** For an ordinary command (one form, one submit
action, which is most of them) local state and the `postCommand` call live directly inside the
component. This is the common case and needs nothing more:

```tsx
// ReserveBike.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { postCommand, ApiError } from '../../../../lib/api'; // one less '../' if this command has no lane segment

export interface ReserveBikeProps {
  bikeId: string;
  customerId: string;
  onSuccess?: (result: unknown) => void;
  onError?: (error: ApiError) => void;
}

export function ReserveBike({ bikeId, customerId, onSuccess, onError }: ReserveBikeProps) {
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    setSubmitting(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const result = await postCommand('/api/reservebike', { bikeId, customerId });
      onSuccess?.(result);
    } catch (err) {
      const message = err instanceof ApiError ? err.message : 'Something went wrong';
      setError(message);
      if (err instanceof ApiError) onError?.(err);
    } finally {
      setSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  // ...JSX translated from the marked screen fragment, wired to handleSubmit...
}
```

The component owns only: local form/loading/error state, whatever client-side validation the
`specifications[]`/field `optional` flags imply, building the request body from props, and calling
`postCommand(command.apiEndpoint, body)`. It never imports `supabase`, builds headers, or calls
`fetch` directly — that is exclusively `src/lib/api.ts`'s job. In `VITE_DATA_MODE=mock`,
`postCommand` never hits the network at all — it resolves immediately, so this component is fully
exercisable (submitting/success/error UI states) offline.

**Extract a `use<CommandTitle>.ts` hook only when it earns its keep** — e.g. the exact same logic
is genuinely reused by more than one component in this slice, or the non-rendering logic (several
async steps, non-trivial multi-field validation) has grown large enough that pulling it out of the
component measurably improves readability. Don't extract a hook by default, for uniformity with
other slices, or "for consistency" — a small command's logic reads perfectly fine inline, and a
hook file that's just a thin wrapper around `postCommand` is pure ceremony working against
deletability, not for it (one more file to keep in sync instead of one). When it *is* warranted,
move the same logic verbatim into a colocated `use<CommandTitle>.ts` and have the component call
it — nothing about the logic itself changes, only where it lives.

## Step 4 — Add numbered samples

Every command component ships a `samples/` folder colocated next to it, mirroring
`build-state-view`'s convention:
`src/slices/<contextSlug>/<laneSlug>/<sliceFolder>/samples/sample-<N>.json`. Since this component
is driven entirely by props, each sample is a **full set of prop values** — there's no query for
`postCommand` to serve (it's already mock-aware on its own, see Step 3). A sample is for whatever
renders this component in isolation (a `src/pages/` composition, or ad hoc while developing) to
spread as props, e.g. `<ReserveBike {...sample1} onSuccess={...} />`.

Add `sample-1.json` for the ordinary case (`command.fields[].example` values); add more numbered
ones for other scenarios `specifications[]` calls out (an edge case, an `optional` field omitted,
...). As in `build-state-view`, the same number across different components' samples is meant to
represent one coherent scenario across the app, not an arbitrary per-component index.

## Step 5 — Context/Provider, only if the marked fragment needs shared local state

Skip this step for the overwhelming majority of commands — an ordinary single-form command is
fully covered by Step 3 alone, and adding a Context there is needless indirection with nothing to
show for it.

Reach for a Context **only** when the blueprint from Step 2 decomposes into several sibling
components that must coordinate (e.g. a multi-step wizard, a shared "selected row" between a list
and a submit bar) — i.e. state that a single component's own `useState` genuinely cannot hold
because more than one sibling needs to read or change it. Follow the same `Context`/`Provider`/hook
shape this project's components use elsewhere (see `useReadOnly`/`ReadOnlyProvider` and
`useUser`/`UserProvider` for the two variants):

```tsx
// ReserveBikeContext.tsx — colocated in the SAME slice folder, never in src/lib
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

interface ReserveBikeContextType {
  selectedBikeId: string | null;
  selectBike: (bikeId: string) => void;
}

const ReserveBikeContext = createContext<ReserveBikeContextType | null>(null);

export function ReserveBikeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // ...state shared by this slice's sibling components...
  return <ReserveBikeContext.Provider value={{ selectedBikeId, selectBike }}>{children}</ReserveBikeContext.Provider>;
}

export function useReserveBikeContext() {
  const ctx = useContext(ReserveBikeContext);
  if (!ctx) throw new Error('useReserveBikeContext must be used within ReserveBikeProvider');
  return ctx;
}
```

Throw when the context is missing (as above) — there is no sensible default for slice-scoped state,
and failing fast surfaces a sub-component rendered outside its own slice's provider immediately.
A plain default value (no throw) is only appropriate for a genuinely app-wide, always-available
value — that belongs in `src/lib`, not here (see **Deletability** in `.build-kit/CLAUDE.md`).

**File**: `src/slices/<contextSlug>/<laneSlug>/<sliceFolder>/<CommandTitle>Context.tsx` — colocated
with the hook and component, never imported by another slice. The command's own `.tsx` file
renders the `Provider` at its root, wrapping the sibling sub-components that call the context hook.

## Step 6 — Compose onto the shared page, if this screen's name is shared

A screen's **title is the page name**. The `html-screen` skill gives each slice its own copy of a
shared visual screen — one node per slice, each with a different mark — so two slices whose
screens carry the **same title** are meant to sit together on **one real page**, arranged exactly
as their marks show. The number of *distinct* screen titles across the board is a direct hint at
how many pages this app needs — not one page per slice.

1. Check whether any other slice references a screen with the same `title` as this slice's screen.
   Search every context's local index, not just this slice's own:
   ```bash
   grep -l '"title": *"<ScreenTitle>"' .build-kit/.slices/*/index.json
   ```
   (Run `/load-slice` with no filter first if the board's other slices haven't been pulled locally
   yet — this check is only as complete as what's on disk.)
2. **No match** (this is the only slice on this screen so far): nothing further to do here — this
   slice's component stands alone for now. A shared page gets created the first time a *second*
   slice on the same screen is built.
3. **Match found**: this screen is a shared page. Its composition lives at
   `src/pages/<ScreenTitle>.tsx` (PascalCase, spaces stripped) — the **one place** in this codebase
   allowed to import across slice folders; a slice component itself never does (see **Deletability**
   in `.build-kit/CLAUDE.md`).
   - Fetch the **whole, unmarked** page markup for this screen (every entry in `meta.pages`, from
     Step 2) — this is the page-level layout blueprint, not just this slice's marked fragment.
   - Translate it 1:1 into JSX, same rule as Step 3 — but at each position carrying a
     `data-em-mark-id`, render that mark's owning slice's component instead of the mockup's static
     content there, passing whatever props it declares. Only substitute positions whose slice
     component already exists; leave any not-yet-built slice's marked area as the mockup's static
     placeholder until that slice is built and this step runs again for it.
   - The page owns threading shared inputs (route/query params, the current session, etc.) down as
     props to each slice component — a slice component still only knows its own declared props, not
     the rest of the page or its siblings.
   - If `src/pages/<ScreenTitle>.tsx` already exists, update only this slice's marked position;
     leave every other position (already-wired slices, and untouched mockup content) exactly as is.

## Step 7 — Verify against slice.json

After writing the hook/component (and context/page, if any), confirm:
- Every prop matches a `command.fields[]` entry exactly (name + type) — no invented or missing
  fields.
- The `postCommand` call uses `command.apiEndpoint` verbatim — or, when it was missing at build
  time, the provisional `/api/mock/...` path noted in a comment (Step 1).
- At least one numbered sample exists under this slice's `samples/` folder, shaped exactly like
  this component's props.
- If a screen was read in Step 2, the rendered JSX matches the marked (or whole, if unmarked)
  HTML fragment structurally — no invented buttons/fields the mockup didn't show, nothing from
  the mockup silently dropped.
- Nothing in this slice's folder is imported from another slice's folder, and nothing outside this
  slice's folder imports from it except `src/pages/` (Step 6) — deleting the folder should delete
  the feature cleanly.

## Quality gate

Run `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) and `npm run lint` (`oxlint`) — both must pass clean.
There is no component test runner configured in this stack yet; if a slice's `specifications[]`
demand behavioral tests, flag that gap via `request-feedback` rather than inventing a test setup
ad hoc.
